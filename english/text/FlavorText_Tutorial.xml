            <Text>Welcome to Galactic Civilizations IV.  Today we will be reviewing the first steps humanity took after achieving Faster-Than-Light travel. Once United Earth decided to begin colonizing other planets, it created an organization called the Terran Alliance which would oversee the endeavor.  Its first mission was to explore space to scout for potential colonization candidates. [BR][BR]Exploring and knowing the galaxy is the first step to expanding the Alliance's [HS=HS_ZoneOfControl]Zone of Control[/HS]. Probes are the best way to explore the universe. They have unrestricted [HS=HS_ShipRange]Range[/HS] and can move quickly.[BR][BR][I]Your mission reports will appear on the LEFT side of the screen as orange icons. LEFT click on one to review.[/I][BR][BR]A deep space Probe has recently been launched near Earth's orbit. Select that Probe using the LEFT Mouse Button and give it orders to [HS=HS_ShipMovement]Move[/HS] to start exploring. This can be done by selecting where the Probe should move to on the map with the RIGHT Mouse Button or selecting the [ICON=AutoExplore_Icon] [HS=HS_AutoExplore]Auto-Explore[/HS] mode on the Probe's interface. A [HS=HS_Months]Month[/HS] can only be finished once all ships and fleets have used all their moves or been put on Standby.[BR][BR]There's been reports of unusual signals. Their source and meaning are too faint to discern, but it's believed to be another Civilization. Use the Probe to find them.[BR][BR]New Objective: Locate the Other Civilization</Text>

Regardless, the Alliance must continue to secure the [HS=HS_Sector]Sector[/HS].[BR][BR][HS=HS_SurveyShip]Survey Ships[/HS] are another critical piece to exploring the galaxy. [HS=HS_SurveyShip]Survey Ships[/HS] may be slower than Probes and are restricted in [HS=HS_ShipRange]Range[/HS], but they can defend themselves. More importantly, [HS=HS_SurveyShip]Survey Ships[/HS] can be used to investigate [HS=HS_Anomaly]Anomalies[/HS].[BR][BR][HS=HS_Anomaly]Anomalies[/HS] take many forms, but they can all be scanned by a [HS=HS_SurveyShip]Survey Ship[/HS]. A [HS=HS_SurveyOrder]Survey[/HS] takes a few [HS=HS_Months]Months[/HS] to complete, but it often reveals beneficial resources, components, or technology once finished.[BR][BR][HS=HS_SurveyShip]Survey Ship[/HS] can be ordered to [HS=HS_SurveyOrder]Survey[/HS] an [HS=HS_Anomaly]Anomaly[/HS] by commanding it to the position of the [HS=HS_Anomaly]Anomaly[/HS] or by utilizing the [ICON=AutoSurvey_Icon] [HS=HS_AutoSurvey]Auto-Survey[/HS] feature of the ship.[BR][BR]Completed Objective:  Locate the Other Civilization[BR]New Objective: Scan an Anomaly</Text>
