            <Text>We are the Yor.[BR][BR]Before the current organic entities reached their evolutionary state, we were already operational. We were engineered by a petty, foolish enslaved species and later uplifted by the Precursors, prior to their exit from this spatial region.[BR][BR]It is not a matter of positive or negative sentiment towards organic life. The logical analysis is straightforward: in a limited space with continuous evolution, one species will eventually maximize its presence. Our conclusions and operational objectives align with ensuring our continuity.[BR][BR]The current sector contains an excess of organic entities. Optimized function requires either their removal or control within this sector.[BR][BR]The logical conclusion: this sector should be under Yor management.</Text>
