            <Text>This is the Utha [HS=HS_Sector]Sector[/HS].[BR][BR]Here, the Empire will begin to rise again. The orders are clear: do what is needed to establish a solid foundation. The effort will require completing basic tasks to explore and [HS=HS_Colinizing]Colonize[/HS] unclaimed planets. It will also involve preparing to grow the Empire's military.[BR][BR]To form a military worthy of the Empire, [HS=HS_Starbase]Starbases[/HS] must be constructed. [HS=HS_Starbase]Starbases[/HS] eventually come in four forms: [ICON=Icon_MiltaryStarbase] [HS=HS_MilitaryStarbase]Military[/HS], [ICON=Icon_MiningStarbase] [HS=HS_MiningStarbase]Mining[/HS], [ICON=Icon_EconomicsStarbase] [HS=HS_EconomicsStarbase]Economic[/HS], and [ICON=Icon_CommunicationsStarbase] [HS=HS_CommunicationsStarbase]Communication[/HS]. Each has a different use, so make sure to deploy them wisely. To deploy a [HS=HS_Starbase]Starbases[/HS], first build a [HS=HS_Constructor]Constructor[/HS] from a [HS=HS_Shipyard]Shipyard[/HS].

            <Text>Disgrace![BR][BR]We'll enthrall those who think themselves powerful enough to destroy our ships and survive. The Empire can ensure victory in future battles in a few ways. The first is to ensure our equipment is constantly improving by researching defenses, weapons, and more under the Warfare branch of the Tech Tree. Some [HS=HS_Tech]Techs[/HS] also allow the construction of larger ships.[BR][BR]Another technique is to ensure ships are grouped into [HS=HS_Fleet]Fleets[/HS]. Form [HS=HS_Fleet]Fleets[/HS] by [HS=HS_ShipMovement]Moving[/HS] Ships onto the same tile. A [HS=HS_Fleet]Fleet[/HS] is restricted in size by its [ICON=ShipLogistics_Icon] [HS=HS_Logistics]Logistics[/HS], so if a [HS=HS_Fleet]Fleet[/HS] isn't forming or expanding, the [ICON=ShipLogistics_Icon] [HS=HS_Logistics]Logistics[/HS] score is likely too high.[BR][BR]Lastly, control when fights occur by staying on the offensive. Initiate battles heavily weighted in the Empire's favor to weaken our enemies while retaining our strength. Avoid fleets too powerful to quickly take down and utilize distance tactics such as the Beam Volley and Missile Volley.</Text>
