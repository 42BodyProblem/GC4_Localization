            <Text>Another civilization, the Navigators, seems responsible for the subspace signals. How long they've been here is hard to tell, but it doesn't matter. They are weak and exposed. They will answer to the Drengin soon enough. Conquer the homeworld and claim their capital, take the head so they know resistance is futile.[BR][BR]Completed Objective: Find the Signal's Source[BR]New Objective: Conquer the Navigators' Homeworld</Text>

            <Text>A message loud and clear -The Drengin Empire owns this sector, and all in it will answer to Drengin rule. The Navigators tried to conceal something as their capital fell. A scan of the planet should undo their feeble attempts and reveal what they've hidden.[BR][BR]Completed Objective: Conquer the Navigators' Homeworld[BR]New Objective: Scan the Conquered Homeworld</Text>

            <Text>The completed scan has revealed the Navigators tried to hide a device. A malfunctioning device. They would not have wanted to hide it if it wasn't of value. Whether a weapon or tool, it needs to be treated with care. Once repaired, it may be critical to the Empire's return.[BR][BR]Completed Objective: Scan the Conquered Homeworld</Text>
