There's been a shift, though; there are reports that a new civilization is conducting less than legitimate business. Rumor is that the Xeloxi, previously unknown, are responsible. The Terran Alliance must intervene, bring stability to the system, and deal with this Xeloxi group.[BR][BR]Minor Civilizations have been hurt the most, so a priority should be bringing them under Alliance influence. Once they're secure and the Xeloxi's stream of ill-gotten resources is cut off, the Xeloxi can be dealt with.</String>

        <String>With the establishment of this colony, we have taken our first steps into the galaxy. Our colonists represent everything which makes our people great, and with that they'll have every chance of thriving on this new alien world.</String>

    <StringTable>
        <Label>FIRST_DURANTIUM_DESC</Label>
        <String>Our miners have returned with rocky debris laced with a telltale flicker of silvery-gold: Durantium. More dense and resilient than anything we've seen before, a steady supply will surely lead to new breakthroughs in ship design.</String>

        <String>Thulium is not much to look at, surprisingly dull in texture and color. It's only in higher dimensions that it shows its true character, a stable form of Neutronium, a material of enormous density. This will be a vital component for any number of new systems.</String>

        <String>Our people have built permanent structures in space before, but nothing like this. This starbase is an extension of our very civilization. Everything we do, everything we are, can be found here. From it, we will surely extend our civilization even further.</String>

    <StringTable>
        <Label>FIRST_SUBSPACE_STREAM_TRAVEL_DESC</Label>
        <String>With a flash and a trick of physics, the ship is gone, having traveled farther and faster than any of our kind has traveled before. Today, the galaxy has gotten much, much smaller.</String>
    </StringTable>

        <String>Not every planet we find will be empty; we've known that for some time. But today is the first day we've tried to take one from someone else. Today will mark a victory we will surely celebrate for a long time.</String>

        <String>The scanner readings are inconclusive, but one thing is for certain: this object is old. As our probes maneuver around the strange device, it becomes clear that the beings who made this were vastly more powerful and experienced than we are. It's a privilege to even gaze upon their work.</String>

		<String>The Intueri develop as quickly as those they watch. They can easily comprehend and replicate things they witness; however, their lack of creative thought and ability to problem solve impacts their ability to make their own discoveries.[BR][BR]The collective consciousness of the Intueri had been stagnant for nearly a millennia until they made contact with the Luxar. After first gazing upon their star ships and faster-than-light drives, the Intueri quickly took to the stars. Now they search far and wide for the knowledge of others to expand their own intelligence.</String>

This division will collaborate with top scientific minds, cutting-edge engineering companies, and visionary military strategists to ensure our Dreadnoughts are outfitted with the most powerful weapons, the sturdiest armor, and the most sophisticated support systems known to our civilization.[BR][BR]With this knowledge in hand, our civilization will have access to these monumental starships, which will redefine the very essence of space warfare. Dreadnoughts are the ultimate expression of our civilization's strength and determination, dwarfing all other ship classes with their staggering size, unyielding resilience, and unparalleled destructive capabilities. They are designed to spearhead our fleet, leading the charge into battle and striking fear into the hearts of our adversaries.[BR][BR]With the Dreadnought Doctrine in place, our civilization will be able to command the most formidable force the galaxy has ever seen, ensuring our supremacy and safeguarding our people's future in a vast and uncertain universe.</String>

        <String>Drengin soldiers are savagely effective at ground-based combat, and their naval vessels are famously tough. Their military manufacturing ability is also impressive, but Drengin colonies do sometimes struggle with discontent.

        <String>The Terran 1st Fleet has returned from the pocket universe, and is tearing its way toward Earth. For the first time in 10 years, the mighty Drengin Empire has a foe worthy of fear, and has begun recalling their most powerful ships in an effort to stop the Terrans before it is too late.[BR][BR]The Torian people have seized this opportunity, and once again overthrown the newly weakened Drengin occupation forces from their home world, seizing the fleet for their own ends. Not one of their oppressors remains alive on Toria.[BR][BR]Envoys from the Arcean Empire and the Terran Alliance have arrived in the Torian space. Will they be the allies Toria need to stay free forever?</String>
