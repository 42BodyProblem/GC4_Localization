ReturnOfKorath_CampaignDec,"The year 2317 heralds the ominous resurgence of the Korath Clan amidst galactic turmoil. [BR][BR]In the annals of the Drengin Empire, the Korath have etched a name for themselves as the epitome of brutality - the quintessential shock troops. Their presence in battle, marked by unprecedented ferocity and a ruthless penchant for destruction, has long been a harbinger of dread. The Korath harbor a zealous belief in the absolute supremacy of the Drengin, viewing all other forms of life as not only inferior but as existential blights unworthy of existence. This extremist ideology sets them apart, even from the Drengin Empire, known for subjugating rather than annihilating perceived inferiors. Such radical divergence in philosophy eventually led to the Korath's estrangement from the Empire. Further distinguishing themselves, the Korath underwent a sinister transformation after their encounters with the enigmatic Dread Lords, emerging as beings who not only believed themselves to be the pinnacle of Drengin evolution but also as harbingers of annihilation for all other species, including their former Drengin brethren."
