        <String>The year is 2307. The Drengin Empire once dominated this part of the galaxy. All other races served as slaves. The Empire was destined to last forever. But then, the diplomats of Sol III organized a rebellion and overturned Drengin dominance.[BR][BR]The once glorious Drengin Empire was reduced to a single star system. The home system remained untouched. The humans and their allies will not keep the Empire suppressed![BR][BR]Space is quite vast. In the Utha sector, worlds are untouchedâ€”a fresh start. However, It's not entirely isolated. Subspace traffic indicates something else is in this sector. Seek it out and conquer it!</String>

        <Label>Campaign_TheOpportunity_FindSignal_Dec</Label>
        <String>The Empire deemed this sector secluded enough to begin expansion anew. Yet recent subspace signals indicate the sector isn't as isolated as expected. No matter what it is, find the signal's source and stomp it out.</String>

        <String>The Navigators are weak, exposed, and alone. Take their homeworld. It will send a message to their colonies that the Drengin Empire reigns here. They will submit, whether willingly or by force.</String>

        <String>The Navigators think they can hide things from the Drengin Empire. They are wrong. Scanning the recently conquered planet will expose whatever the Navigators don't want to be found.</String>

        <String>The humans and their allies believe they have successfully suppressed the Drengin Empire. They will be proven wrong. The Empire needs resources to return to dominance and subjugate all those inferior species.[BR][BR]So expansion begins here in Utha, an untouched sector of the universe. We are not alone as initially thought. Subspace traffic indicates something else is in the system. It, whatever it may be, can not be allowed to stand in the Empire's way. Seek it out, conquer it.</String>

        <Label>FACTION_DRENGIN_Campaign_TheOpportunity_StartupTraitsDescription</Label>
        <String>There are none more vicious than the Drengin Empire. Borders expand quickly and gathered resources rapidly funneled into the military. Claiming planets and building a fleet will ensure nothing can resist Drengin subjugation.</String>
