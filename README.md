# GC4_Localization
Open project for people who want to help translate Galactic Civilizations IV into a variety of languages.

## Welcome
Greetings and welcome to the **Galactic Civilizations IV community localization project**!

### Overview
In the space 4X game, **Galactic Civilizations IV**, there's a sub-directory called `\Data`. Inside, you'll find various language directories, such as English, German, French, etc. These directories hold the localized text for the game. And trust us, there's a lot in here.

### Tools and Editing
We've provided a simple Python GUI app in the main directory of the repository. This tool lets you view the English text and your chosen language side-by-side, making translation easier. Feel free to modify the app as you see fit. If you're feeling adventurous, you can even integrate an OpenAI key to utilize ChatGPT for assistance. However, remember not to share your key. And while the idea is fun, we don't encourage spending money on this project. After all, this is about enjoying the process and helping fellow gamers from around the globe experience this fantastic space 4X game.

### Contributions and Recognition
When you're ready to share your translations, check in your changes. Our team will review submissions to decide what becomes an official part of the game. We appreciate every contribution, and if you make significant edits, we'll make a dedicated effort to include your name in the game's official credits.

### Game Language Support
Keep in mind, the game will only support languages other than English after September 2023. But if you're using the September 1 Insider's branch, you can select your language from the Options menu right away.

Happy translating, good luck, and most importantly, have fun!
