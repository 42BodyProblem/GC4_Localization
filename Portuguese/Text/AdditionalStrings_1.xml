        <String>Despite being the youngest race in the galaxy, the Terrans are perhaps the most dangerous. Inventors of the hyperdrive, it was their decision to spread it to their neighbors which led to the current arms race the galaxy finds itself in.[BR][BR]Although Terrans present themselves as a peaceful and diplomatic people, their reputation is far more mixed. They possess a flair for violence, and a willingness to exercise it. Although Terrans find nothing strange about this dichotomy, many of their galactic peers regard it as alarming, and even duplicitous.</String>

They see other sentient species as prey to be hunted, and hosts for their larvae. The Festron take an extraordinarily long view of this activity, and have been known to drop lone individuals onto worlds to spend generations lurking and hunting the local population. Some are rumored to have even reached as far as Earth. Bottom line: there is no sharing worlds with the Festron.</String>

        <String>A civilization founded entirely on the principles of self-interest leads to a curious side-effect (at least in the eyes of an outsider): every Xeloxi citizen is a criminal. The Xeloxi government, no less criminal itself, maintains control over this unruly mob through brutal and often random displays of power. Surprisingly, this seemingly unworkable system - which other civilizations might see as the darkest chapters of their history - is not only stable for the Xeloxi, but actually allows them to thrive.</String>

A gesture which led to the arms race which nearly pushed them to the brink of destruction.

A few days after turning it on an answer was received: a fleet of warships appearing in orbit; raiders arriving en masse to collect every child on the planet. An entire generation, lost. Humiliated at their unsophisticated thinking, the surviving Manti and the generations that followed, began exploring space on their own.
