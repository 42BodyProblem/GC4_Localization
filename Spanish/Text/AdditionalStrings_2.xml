The home system remained untouched. The humans and their allies will not keep the Empire suppressed![BR][BR]Space is quite vast. In the Utha sector, worlds are untouched&#8212;a fresh start.

        <String>Even in 2307, the Yor Singularity remains a powerful force in the Galaxy. Long have they strived to bring others into their collective consciousness -the Totatily. Though their programming compels them to continue to expand and convert organic to synthetic, they are far from alone among the stars.[BR][BR]The Singularity must make several critical decisions that will determine their efforts for decades.

        <String>The Yor are artificial beings, originally servants of an ancient species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. Whether due to some hidden command of the Dread Lords, or simply from applying the cold rules of logic, the Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and now despise all biological lifeforms. Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak and negotiate with organic beings. Those beings should understand that this is nothing but a short-term ploy, and that their new friends will never rest until they, and all other organic life, are destroyed.</String>

        <String>The Corporate Sector is the apex corporate entity of an ultra-capitalistic society, the only organization capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the entire Iridium people. The Iridium culture is based on a firm, even fanatical belief in the power of free markets. Although no strangers to weaponry, all research is first considered through the lens of mutual cooperation; the destructive cost of warfare is often too great for Iridiums to seriously consider. It remains to be seen how well this philosophy will fare when introduced to more close-minded races.</String>
